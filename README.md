# PayloadGen + ZAP Integration Toolkit 🔥🛡️

**PayloadGen** is a Python-based toolkit that simplifies payload generation and automated web scanning through seamless integration with the OWASP ZAP API. It features a user-friendly GUI, preloaded attack payloads (XSS, SQLi, CMDi), and generates clean, easy-to-read HTML vulnerability reports.

This tool is built for bug bounty hunters, ethical hackers, cybersecurity students, and red teams who want fast, scriptable scanning power with a no-hassle interface.

Manual recon and scanning can slow down your workflow. PayloadGen helps automate the process by:
