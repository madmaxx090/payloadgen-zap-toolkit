# PayloadGen + ZAP Integration Toolkit 🔥🛡️

**PayloadGen** is a Python-based toolkit that simplifies payload generation and automated web scanning through seamless integration with the OWASP ZAP API. It features a user-friendly GUI, preloaded attack payloads (XSS, SQLi, CMDi), and generates clean, easy-to-read HTML vulnerability reports.

This tool is built for bug bounty hunters, ethical hackers, cybersecurity students, and red teams who want fast, scriptable scanning power with a no-hassle interface.

## 🧠 Why Use This Tool?

Manual scanning can slow down your workflow. PayloadGen helps automate the process by:

- Reducing time spent writing/reusing payloads
- Scanning web targets without opening ZAP manually
- Offering a visual GUI interface instead of just CLI
- Generating scan reports automatically for evidence
